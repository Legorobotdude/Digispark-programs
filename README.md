# Digispark-programs
All of my Digispark programs

These are all released for personal use, not for comertial, though I do not see why anyone would use my code for a product
release, but if you want to please do email me at david_hickox@yahoo.com and open a issue on this repository. 

These are just things I have written for the digispark to mess arround and learn better programming skills.
